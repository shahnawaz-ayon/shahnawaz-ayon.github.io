Key Changes Made:

Unified Styling: Removed the conflict between Bootstrap and Tailwind by using Tailwind CSS exclusively for the layout and responsiveness. This makes the code much cleaner and faster.
Main Container: Wrapped all the content in a central container (max-w-6xl) to ensure it looks good on large screens without stretching too wide.
Plain JavaScript: Replaced the heavy jQuery/Bootstrap dependencies with Vanilla JavaScript for the accordion and mobile menu.
Responsive Design: The layout now adapts perfectly to mobile devices (Hamburger menu, stacking grids).
Visual Polish: Improved typography, added shadows, rounded corners, and smooth transitions.
Placeholders: Added placeholder images for your local files (1.jpg, etc.) so you can see the layout immediately.
